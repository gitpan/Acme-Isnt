NAME
       Acme::Isn't - Determine whether your objects are NOT a certain class.

SYNOPSIS
           use Acme::Isn't;
           use Some::OO::Module;
           my $obj = Some::Other::OO::Module->new();
           die EDOOFUS if $obj->isn't('Some::OO::Module');

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows a programmer to determine conclusively whether their
       objects are not of a certain type. This sort of test can be useful to
       e.g. programmatically enforce inheritance hierarchies. This allows for
       much cleaner code than using unless and isa.

USAGE
       "Acme::Isn't" is a bit magical. You can use the "isn't" method on any
       object you create, and just pass it a class name that you want to
       ensure that your object is not. "isn't" returns 1 if true, 0 if false.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       This module was almost wholly inspired by Damian Conway's Acme::Don't
       module.
